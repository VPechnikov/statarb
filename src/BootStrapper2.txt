    progress the rolling window by one day

    examine positions of anything in portfolio (risk method as check risk / current exposure)

        - these need to go straight into cointegration analysis

    perform clustering()

    cointegration analysis(hgcdvcjhdk)

    normalise u_t from result of cointegration

    plot and save current metrics (sset returns, cumulative returns, kurtosis, skew, vol, max drawdown etc.)
